<H1>School</H1>

<p> I live in Knox Hall with a friend from High School. Since I am currently undecided as to what my major will be, I am taking a wide variety of classes this semester. My favorite classes are Philosophy, English, and BUA and my least favorite classes are my lectures for microeconomics and astronomy. </p>
