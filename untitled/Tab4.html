<h1>Family Life</h1>

<p>I have one brother and three sisters. I am the youngest of the children. Most of my family on my dad's side lives in Maine, while most of my family on my mother's side lives in New Jersey or South Carolina. My dad has a black lab named Reese and my mom had a chocolate lab, golden retriever mix, named Holly. </p>
