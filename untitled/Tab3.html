<H1>Personal interests</H1>

<p>In my free time, I like to play music, hang out with my friends, and read. I frequently go out to play ping pong and watch movies with my friends. I have been playing the trumpet since fifth grade and I recently started focusing specifically on jazz music. Some of my favorite books are "Lord of The Rings" by Tolkien, "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, and "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius. </p>
